### Project 6 - Build a JS turn-based board game

#### Project deliverables: 
* Randomly generate the game map 
* Randomly add 2 players, obstacles, and a maximum of 4 different weapons
* Game players shouldn't touch each other
* Game weapons can be of any type (e.g.: programming languages)
* Each weapon can inflict different damage points (default weapon must inflict 10 pts damage) 
* Game obstacles represent the unavailable (dimmed) boxes, players can't pass through these directly
* For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically)
* If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one
* If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins
* During battle: each player attacks in turn
* During battle: the damage depends on the player's weapon
* During battle: the player can choose to attack or defend against the next shot
* During battle: if a player chooses to defend, they sustain 50% less damage than normal
* As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over.
